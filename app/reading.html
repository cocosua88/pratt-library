            <p>I stare down at my shoes, watching as a fine layer of ash 
                settles on the worn leather. This is where the bed I shared 
                with my sister, Prim, stood. Over there was the kitchen 
                table. The bricks of the chimney, which collapsed in a 
                charred heap, provide a point of reference for the rest of the 
                house. How else could I orient myself in this sea of gray? 
                Almost nothing remains of District 12. 
                <br />
                <br />
                A month ago, 
                the Capitol’s firebombs obliterated the poor coal miners’ houses in the Seam, the shops in the town, even the Justice Building. The only area that escaped incineration was the Victor’s Village. I don’t know why exactly. Perhaps so 
                anyone forced to come here on Capitol business would 
                have somewhere decent to stay. The odd reporter. A committee assessing the condition of the coal mines. A squad of Peacekeepers checking for returning refugees. 
                <br />
                <br />
                But no one is returning except me. And that’s only for 
                a brief visit. The authorities in District 13 were against my 
                coming back. They viewed it as a costly and pointless venture, 
                given that at least a dozen invisible hovercraft are circling 
                overhead for my protection and there’s no intelligence to 
                be gained. I had to see it, though. So much so that I made it a condition of my cooperating with any of their plans.
                <br />
                <br />
                Finally, Plutarch Heavensbee, the Head Gamemaker 
                who had organized the rebels in the Capitol, threw up his 
                hands. “Let her go. Better to waste a day than another 
                month. Maybe a little tour of Twelve is just what she needs 
                to convince her we’re on the same side.”
                <br />
                <br />
                The same side. A pain stabs my left temple and I press 
                my hand against it. Right on the spot where Johanna Mason 
                hit me with the coil of wire. The memories swirl as I try to 
                sort out what is true and what is false. What series of events 
                led me to be standing in the ruins of my city? This is hard 
                because the effects of the concussion she gave me haven’t completely subsided and my thoughts still have a tendency to jumble together. Also, the drugs they use to control my 
                pain and mood sometimes make me see things. I guess. 
                I’m still not entirely convinced that I was hallucinating the 
                night the floor of my hospital room transformed into a carpet of writhing snakes. 
                I use a technique one of the doctors suggested. I start 
                with the simplest things I know to be true and work toward 
                the more complicated. The list begins to roll in my head. . . .
                My name is Katniss Everdeen. I am seventeen years old. My 
                home is District 12. I was in the Hunger Games. I escaped. The 
                Capitol hates me. Peeta was taken prisoner. He is thought to be 
                dead. Most likely he is dead. It is probably best if he is dead. . . <br />
                <br />
                “Katniss. Should I come down?” My best friend Gale’s 
                voice reaches me through the headset the rebels insisted I 
                wear. He’s up in a hovercraft, watching me carefully, ready 
                to swoop in if anything goes amiss. I realize I’m crouched 
                down now, elbows on my thighs, my head braced between 
                my hands. I must look on the verge of some kind of breakdown. This won’t do. Not when they’re finally weaning me 
                off the medication.
                I straighten up and wave his offer away. “No. I’m fine.” 
                To reinforce this, I begin to move away from my old house 
                and in toward the town. Gale asked to be dropped off in 
                12 with me, but he didn’t force the issue when I refused 
                his company. He understands I don’t want anyone with me 
                today. Not even him. Some walks you have to take alone.
                The summer’s been scorching hot and dry as a bone. 
                There’s been next to no rain to disturb the piles of ash left 
                by the attack. They shift here and there, in reaction to my 
                footsteps. No breeze to scatter them. 
                <br />
                <br />
                I keep my eyes on 
                what I remember as the road, because when I first landed 
                in the Meadow, I wasn’t careful and I walked right into 
                a rock. Only it wasn’t a rock — it was someone’s skull. It 
                rolled over and over and landed faceup, and for a long time 
                I couldn’t stop looking at the teeth, wondering whose they 
                were, thinking of how mine would probably look the same 
                way under similar circumstances. 
                I stick to the road out of habit, but it’s a bad choice, 
                because it’s full of the remains of those who tried to flee. 
                Some were incinerated entirely. But others, probably overcome with smoke, escaped the worst of the flames and now 
                lie reeking in various states of decomposition, carrion for 
                scavengers, blanketed by flies. I killed you, I think as I pass 
                a pile. And you. And you. 
                Because I did. It was my arrow, aimed at the chink in 
                the force field surrounding the arena, that brought on this 6
                firestorm of retribution. That sent the whole country of 
                Panem into chaos.
